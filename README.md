APlay
---
A Better(Maybe) iOS Audio Stream & Play Swift Framework


Usage
---
```Swift
import APlay
...
let url = URL(string: "path/to/audio/resource")!
let player = APlay()
player.eventPipeline.delegate(to: self, with: { (target, event) in
    //  event handling
})
player.play(url)
...
```

⚠️⚠️⚠️ Known issue
---
This project can only run in `DEBUG` mode，cause optimization mode will pause the decode loop.

if install with CocoaPods, add this block of code in your podfile
```ruby
post_install do |installer|
 installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
        target.build_configurations.each do |config|
            swiftPods = ['APlay']
            if swiftPods.include?(target.name)
                config.build_settings['SWIFT_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL'] =  '-Onone'
            end
        end
    end
end
```
